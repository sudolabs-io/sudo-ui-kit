# Commit Message Rule

When creating commit messages for component migrations, follow these conventions:

## New Component Migration
For new components being added to registry.json:
```
Component Name component migration
- Added component files (component.tsx and stories.tsx)
- Added component to registry.json with dependencies
- Added component documentation and metadata
- Other needed description
```

Example:
```
Rating component migration
- Added rating.tsx and rating.stories.tsx
- Added rating to registry.json with lucide-react dependency
- Added rating documentation and metadata
```

## Follow-up Changes
For changes to existing components:
```
fix: Component Name component changes
- Updated component dependencies
- Fixed component implementation
- Updated component documentation
```

Example:
```
fix: Button component changes
- Updated button dependencies to latest versions
- Fixed button variant styles
- Updated button documentation with new examples
```

## Guidelines
1. Component names should be in PascalCase in the commit title
2. Use bullet points for clear, concise change descriptions
3. Keep bullet points focused on the main changes
4. Include both implementation and documentation changes
5. For follow-up changes, always start with "fix:" prefix
